## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Summary
Codebook contains additional info about variables and transformations

## Data Set

Contains results of experiements using a group of 30 volunteers aged 19-48 years.  Each person performed six activities (walking, wlaking_upstairs,
walking_downstaist, sitting, standing, laying) while wearing a smartphoe on their waist. Using an embedded accelrometer and gyroscope, 3 axial 
linear acceleration adn 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz was captured. The dataset was split into 2
groups; test and training.

Each record contained:
an identifier of the subject
an activity label 
acceleration from teh accelerometer and the body acceleration
angular velocity from the gyroscope
561 variable vector with the time variables


## Manipulations

Read in files from provided texts and merged together to create one dataset.  Then extracted the mean and standard deviations
of each measurement.  And merged to include the activity labels.  Then I labeled the data set with descriptive names
and then produced a dataset with the average of each mean by subject and activity type.
